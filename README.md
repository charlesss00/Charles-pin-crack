First I ran the server into the local host and made a comman to know the route of the application.
I used brute-force attack using python to automate the number guess from 0 to 1000 to guess the right number it attempts and checks if the pin is the correct one and then
it skips if it is wrong. It was a bit challenging to find the route at first and the local host since I had no idea that the address is the local host until
it came up to my mind that the server is literally running on the local host and the route part, I used google for the comman.

After that I opened a web browser which is http://127.0.0.1:8888

The web is the one with the challenge to crack the code and then it accepts PIN inputs.

I ran the python script in my visual code so it runs live and attempts while the web is open.

Eventually the python number guess stopped at a specific number which is 981 then I typed it in the web and then successfully cracked the code.
